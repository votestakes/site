VoteStakes is a social media game that lets friends enter into social contracts to encourage each other to participate in elections.

-----

How it works:

1. Search for an upcoming election or voting event
2. Select one or more friends to challenge to vote
3. Pick the stakes if one of you fails to vote
4. When it's time to vote, take a geotagged-photo to confirm you were at your polling location
